	\item 10 to 11 pt font-size
	\item 1.5 linespacing
\end{itemize}

class. This commands will set the internal command \lcs{@supervisor} to
contain the name of the supervisor supporting this thesis.

the supervisor in the style you like. The text ''Georg-August-Universit\"at
G\"ottingen\lcs{newline}Thesis Proposal'' has to come up at first. Then title,
